### App Store Connect stats in your menubar!

SwiftyStats is a lightweight menubar macOS application designed for indie app developers. It provides easy access to your recent installation data from App Store Connect, all from the convenience of your Mac’s menubar.


### Getting Started:

Link your Apple App Store account and authorize access via your Admin account on App Store Connect.

Generate an API key with Admin privileges on the Integrations page to ensure seamless communication between SwiftyStats and your account.

All credentials are securely stored in your Mac’s Keychain. SwiftyStats does not share any data with third parties; it only interacts directly with the App Store Connect API.


### Important Note:

SwiftyStats utilizes the Sales Report API for its data, so there may be slight discrepancies compared to the Analytics and Trends pages on App Store Connect due to report availability.


Requirements:

- Membership in the Apple Developer Program
- At least one app distributed on the App Store
- An App Store Connect account with permissions to create API keys
