# Step-by-Step Guide to Create a JQL Query

1. ### Log In and Access the Search Interface:

    Sign into your JIRA Cloud account.
    Click on "Issues and filters" in the left sidebar or select "Search for issues" in the dropdown if you are in a different section.

2. ### Switch to JQL Search:

    In the search interface, you might see the basic search options by default. Look for a switch or link to Advanced Search and click it. This will open the JQL search interface.

3. ### Begin Crafting Your Query:

    Youâ€™ll see a text field where you can enter your JQL query.

4. ### Understand Basic Syntax:

    JQL queries are structured as `field operator value`. For example, `status = "Open"`.

    - `field` refers to the issue attribute (like status, summary, assignee).
    - `operator` is how you want to compare the field (e.g., =, !=, >, <).
    - `value` is what you are comparing the field to (like a specific status name, a user, etc.).

5. ### Use Logical Operators for Complex Queries:

    Combine different criteria using operators like AND, OR, and NOT. E.g., `project = "MYPROJECT" AND status = "Open"`.

6. ### Leverage Functions and Keywords:

    JIRA Cloud also supports various functions like `currentUser()` or dates like `startOfDay()`.

7. ### Execute the Query:

    After typing your query, run it by either pressing Enter or clicking the Search button.

8. ### Refine Your Query as Needed:

    Based on the results, you might want to refine or adjust your query.

9. ### Use created query in GojiBar

    Copy the query and paste it under Preferences -> Tabs in GojiBar.

# Example JQL Queries

Find issues assigned to you in a specific project:
```
project = "MYPROJECT" AND assignee = currentUser()
```

Search for recently updated high-priority issues:

```
priority = High AND updated >= -1w
```

Issues reported by you that are still open:
```
reporter = currentUser() AND status != Closed
```
